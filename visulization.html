    <h1>Data Visulization</h1>
    <p>Based on our optimal water level algorithm, we have made predictions on the Five Great Lake’s best water level from 2018 to 2020, to satisfy the general benefit of three classes of stakeholders surrounding the Five Great Lakes. 
        Followings are the visualization of each lake’s optimal value during three-year period.</p>
    
    <p>In general, all the optimal water levels of these lakes reached a peak during summer, while dropped down to the bottom during the period of winter or spring, partly contributed by the icebergs merging, and the seasonal needs for multiple stakeholders. 
        Furthermore, based on the altitude, various lakes’ optimal water levels differ within a range.</p>
