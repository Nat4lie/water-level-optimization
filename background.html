    <h1>Backgound Information</h1>
    <p>The Great Lakes, a magnificent expanse of interconnected freshwater lakes, are located in the east-central part of North America. 
        This natural marvel consists of five primary lakes: Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. 
        They form one of the largest freshwater systems on Earth, holding about 21% of the world's surface fresh water. 
        The waterways connect through a network of rivers and lakes, culminating in the Saint Lawrence River, which serves as a passage to the Atlantic Ocean.</p> 
    
    <p>Formed about 14,000 years ago from retreating ice sheets at the end of the Last Glacial Period, the Great Lakes have since been a central hub for transportation, trade, and biodiversity. 
        With environments ranging from industrial megacities to unspoiled wilderness, the Great Lakes Basin is a vital ecological treasure, a significant economic resource, and home to a vast array of plant and animal species. </p>
